ACCIDENT INSTANT EMERGENCY AID CALL SYSTEM (KazaAniAcilYardimCagriSistemi)
The aim of the project is to make an emergency call system at the time of accident using FasterRCNN(Region Based Convolutional Networks), GPS(Global Positioning System) and GSM(Global
System for Mobile Communications) technologies.
The first stage of this multi-stage project is as follows;Analysis of still images can be performed using
image processing methods, and meaningful information can be extracted from those images.It is one
of the factors that make it difficult to find the object to be followed after detection and recognition in
a variable environment.Different methods have been implemented in order to cope with such
challenging elements and to perform object tracking successfully.These systems, which have been
reinforced with artificial intelligence based components in recent years, provide both faster and
sharper target detection.On the other hand, deep learning algorithms have also revolutionized the field
of artificial intelligence.Using deep learning algorithms in image processing provides very successful
results and complex image processing problems can be solved easily.In this study, TensorFlow,
Google's open source machine learning library, was used for deep learning and mobile object
recognition and tracking.Faster R-CNN model from Region Based Convolutional Networks library
has been handled for object tracking.These libraries have been trained with pre-trained Car, Person,
Accident tags, and object recognition has been performed on still images, video images and webcam
images. In the next stage, the Faster R-CNN model is based on sending the current location of the
accident detected in the video image using the SMS sending technique, which is an IOT technology.It
is aimed to determine the location information according to the data received from the satellite
through the GPS Module and to send them to the phone of the predefined persons as SMS using the
GSM Module.Thus, it is predicted that the casualties will decrease with early intervention to the
victims.
